## Installation

### Installation without CLI

If you are a user of before 16.04 or of among 16.04 and 17.10 and any Debian-derived distros: 

1. Then you must download and install firstly [Suru Icons](https://github.com/snwh/suru-icon-theme/) by Sam Hewitt;
2. Unzip this zipped file and move the folder "Suru" to `your_name/.icons/` (16.04 and below) or `your_name/.local/share/icons/` (16.04.4 and above);
3. Now download Suru++ and unzip this zipped file and move the folder "Suru-Plus" to `your_name/.icons/` (16.04 and below) or `your_name/.local/share/icons/` (16.04.4 and above);
4. Apply "Suru-Plus", using Tweak Tool.

If you are a user of 18.04: 

1. Ubuntu 18.04 comes already with Suru icons installed;
2. Download Suru++ and unzip this zipped file and move the folder "Suru-Plus" to `your_name/.local/share/icons/`;
3. Apply "Suru-Plus", using Tweak Tool.

### Installation with CLI

Firstly, you must have `git` and `svn` installed. 

```shell
sudo apt install curl git subversion wget
```

* **Ubuntu 16.04 and below and any Debian-derived distros**
```shell
# If the folder icons doesn't exist
mkdir ~/.icons
# As you are an user of before Ubuntu 16.04 and below, you must install firstly Sam Hewitt' Suru Icons
svn export https://github.com/snwh/suru-icon-theme/trunk/Suru/ ~/.icons/Suru
# Download quickly like a Millennium Falcon
svn export https://github.com/Magog64/SURU-PLUS/trunk/ ~/.icons/Suru++
# When we will update the icons, and if you want to update the icons, just overwrite
svn export --force https://github.com/Magog64/SURU-PLUS/trunk/ ~/.icons/Suru++
```

* **Ubuntu 16.04.4 and above**
```shell
# If the folder icons doesn't exist
mkdir ~/.local/share/icons
# As you are an user of before Ubuntu 16.04 and above, you must install firstly Sam Hewitt' Suru Icons
svn export https://github.com/snwh/suru-icon-theme/trunk/Suru/ ~/.local/share/icons/Suru
# Download quickly like a Millennium Falcon
svn export https://github.com/Magog64/SURU-PLUS/trunk/ ~/.local/share/icons/Suru++
# When we will update the icons, and if you want to update the icons, just overwrite
svn export --force https://github.com/Magog64/SURU-PLUS/trunk/ ~/.local/share/icons/Suru++
```

* **Ubuntu 18.04 and above**

You do not need to download and install Sam Hewitt's Suru Icon, because it already comes installed under Ubuntu 18.04 and above

```shell
# If the folder icons doesn't exist
mkdir ~/.local/share/icons
# Download quickly like a Millennium Falcon
svn export https://github.com/Magog64/SURU-PLUS/trunk/ ~/.local/share/icons/Suru++
# When we will update the icons, and if you want to update the icons, just overwrite
svn export --force https://github.com/Magog64/SURU-PLUS/trunk/ ~/.local/share/icons/Suru++
```

* **PPA (Ubuntu and Debian-derived)**

Soon...

## Bugs and reports

### Many apps are not well displayed

It is not the pack's problem. It is the desktop files problem because:
* Snap apps - Gnome-Characters, Gnome-Logs, Gravit Designer and Vectr use the different path and use the ICO/PNG extension added instead;
* The desktop files of certain native apps as IBus and Mozc for Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages use the different relative path of an icon, use the PNG format added a SVG extension, turn the icons unrecognisable by the icons packs,

We have already reported these issues:
* CrossFTP: 
* GitHub Desktop: 
* Gravit Designer: https://discuss.gravit.io/t/linux-package-feature-requests/294/20
* IBus: https://github.com/phuang/ibus-pinyin/issues/13
* Mozc Setup: 

We provide desktop files for you. They are in the folder `desktop`. Copy them to `your_name/local/applications/`, so they won't be affected or modified when you make next updates of Ubuntu and/or PPAs.

We recommend you to back your files up when you intend to make a clean install or reinstall your distribution.

* Do you find the missed icons?
* Do you find the misused icons?
* Did you find the errors?

Report, but please provide well-detailed informations:

* Distribution and version
* Steps to reproduce
* Expected behavior
* Actual behavior
* Description
* Missed icons
  * Apps names
  * Missed icon names from the desktop files of `/usr/share/applications` and `yourname/.local/share/applications/`):
  * Screenshots
* Additional information
