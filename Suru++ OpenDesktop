[b]PLEASE UNDERSTAND[/b] that I am [b]NOT[/b] a developer. I am [b]ONLY a designer. [b]PLEASE RESPECT[/b] me and my limit. [b]DO NOT[/b] overload me with these things.
I [b]DO NOT[/b] work with dark icons themes and other icons themes. ONLY Gustavo works with it.

[h4][b]Installation[/b][/h4]

The good news is that, you can say goodbye to non-CLI and CLI instructions and install the PPA like a Millennium Falcon!

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gusbemacbe/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install suru-plus-pack

Do not you like the PPA? No problem, you can have an alternative here:

You can choose two options - with or without CLI, we recommend strongly to use SVN which is quicker like a Millennium Falcon.
